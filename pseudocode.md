### MoSCoW 

#### Must have 

- Let Players know whose move it is 

- Have tiles be only clickable once (This and the next two can be grouped in functionality)
- Have tiles with already filled boxes be unclickable 
- Have tiles be unclickable when game is over (One player wins, draw game)

- Needs to be a restart button that resets board 
- Have tiles fill up with players mark (X or O depending on player and turn)
- Switch mark and player after every turn 

- Only user one div for project 


#### Should have 

- Way of showing players where cursor is floating and putting placeholder mark on hover 
- Allow players to enter their names 
- Have pages be mobile first and look good on different device sizes 
- Allow player histories to be saved so we can see players scores and histories against one another 
- Have player signup area where they can upload a name and image as well as view the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe 
- Have Session score so we can see how players are doing against each other this session 


#### Could have 

- Could have version of tic-tac-toe where users play against computer (tic-tac-toe)
- Could add screen where users choose what game they want to play with signup screen 
- Could have leaderboards that save scores of players and sorts by total amount of games won 
- Could have version that allows users to play connect-4 
- Could have multiplayer aspects incorporated into the game 
  
#### Won't have 

- Will not add any games other than tic-tac-toe and connect-4 
- Will not add any AI elements into the game 
- Will not have different sizes of board available for connect-4 or tic tac toe 
- Will not allow more than 2 players at a time for tic-tac-toe or connect-4 
- Will not have settings where users can alter or change aspects of the game 


### Design of project 

- I believe that there are five main compenents in the first version of the project that contains the must haves of the project. Reset button, Player turn label, board, Marks (X or O by player),
