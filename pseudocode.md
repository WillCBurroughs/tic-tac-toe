## What processes will I follow to complete this project 

- I will use MoSCoW to decide what I must, should, could and will not have 
- I will decide the features that I want to have in this project 
- I will design what the finished project as I envision it would look like 
- I will write out all the functionality of what I would to add would entail 
- I will Write out the versions that this will consist based off of milestones 
- I will begin and iterate over the project versions until I am finished with the project 


### MoSCoW 

#### Must have 

- Let Players know whose move it is 

- Have tiles be only clickable once (This and the next two can be grouped in functionality)
- Have tiles with already filled boxes be unclickable 
- Have tiles be unclickable when game is over (One player wins, draw game)

- Needs to be a restart button that resets board 
- Have tiles fill up with players mark (X or O depending on player and turn)
- Switch mark and player after every turn 

- Only user one div for project 


#### Should have 

- Way of showing players where cursor is floating and putting placeholder mark on hover 
- Allow players to enter their names 
- Have pages be mobile first and look good on different device sizes 
- Allow player histories to be saved so we can see players scores and histories against one another 
- Have player signup area where they can upload a name and image as well as view the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe 
- Have Session score so we can see how players are doing against each other this session
